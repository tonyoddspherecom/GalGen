# GalGen
A galaxy generator

Purpose
This project will provide components capable of generating a random procedural galaxy.

The top level will be a configurable random galaxy with a realistic number of sectors based on a configured base setup.

Sectors will contain stars, again modified by configurable values.

Stars will contain realistic stellar bodies, with configurable variables.

Stellar bodies will have cores, surfaces and terrains all generated procedurally.
